#SE Chat Websockets

To get started, build the required plugins by calling:

     npm install

Then, add your username and password to the relevant strings to your environment place (`.bash_profile` on Mac/Linux, or `.zshenv` if using `zsh`) by adding something like:

     export EMAIL=you@example.com
     export PASSWORD=password

And then copy the config sample file into a `config.json` file.

There you can specify the `star_threshold`, `debug` variable, and rooms.
